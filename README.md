# TheConfigurator

## Project Description
This is a simple configuration library that is designed to give the developer's piece and mind and keep the developers doing what they do best code.

## Who is this library for?
Developers looking for a safer way to develop and keep thier configuration file safe from source control and attackers from exploiting thier **secret files/ configuration files**

## When and where will this library be available?
This library will eventually be hosted via NuGet, once I get a working alpha release going.
