# TheConfigurator

## Project Description
This is a simple configuration library that is designed to give the developer peace of mind, and keep the developers doing what they do best: code.

## Who is this library for?
Developers looking for a safer way to develop and keep their configuration file safe from source control and attackers from exploiting their secrets/configuration files.

## When and where will this library be available?
This library will eventually be hosted via NuGet, once I get a working alpha release going.
